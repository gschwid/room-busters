# Final project for CSCI 4551

## Todo

- Implement a way to give the robot a destination coordinate to traverse too.
- Figure out how to get map of the envoirnment in simulation.
- Implement the RRT* algorithm to find a path to the goal object.
- Create velocity commands from the given path found by RRT*.
- If time allows, SLAM the envoirnment to get a map of it.
